# ðŸ“¸ Carousel Image Quality Guide

## Problem Identified
**Date:** 2025-01-11  
**Issue:** Carousel images were blurry and unreadable

## Root Causes
1. **Low Resolution Source Images**: 
   - avis1.jpg: 151KB (likely decent quality)
   - avis2.jpg: 30KB (very low resolution)
   - avis3.jpg: 34KB (very low resolution)

2. **CSS Filters Aggravating the Problem**:
   - `grayscale(100%)` + `brightness(200%)` = excessive contrast reduction
   - `opacity: 0.7` = further reduced readability

3. **Constrained Display Size**:
   - `max-height: 80px` compressed already low-res images

## Solutions Implemented

### CSS Improvements
```css
.carousel-item img {
  max-width: 100%;
  max-height: 100px;  /* Increased from 80px */
  filter: grayscale(80%) brightness(120%);  /* Reduced intensity */
  opacity: 0.9;  /* Increased opacity */
  image-rendering: -webkit-optimize-contrast;
  image-rendering: crisp-edges;  /* Better rendering */
  transition: var(--transition);
}

.carousel-item img:hover {
  filter: grayscale(0%) brightness(100%);
  opacity: 1;
  transform: scale(1.05);  /* Added zoom effect on hover */
}

.carousel-container {
  height: 140px;  /* Increased from 120px */
  padding: 20px 0;  /* Added breathing room */
}
```

## Recommendations for Future

### Short-term Fixes
1. **Recapture Screenshots** at higher resolution (minimum 500KB per image)
2. **Use PNG format** for text-heavy images to preserve clarity
3. **Optimize images** for web while maintaining readability

### Long-term Solutions
1. **Vector Logos**: Request vector versions (SVG) from partners
2. **High-Resolution Sources**: Always capture/download highest quality available
3. **Image Optimization Pipeline**: Implement automated image optimization

## Image Quality Standards
- **Minimum File Size**: 100KB for readable text
- **Preferred Format**: PNG for screenshots, SVG for logos
- **Resolution**: Minimum 300px width for carousel display

## Zoom Functionality Added
Implemented click-to-zoom feature for carousel images:
- Click any carousel image to view it in a full-screen modal
- Modal shows the image at maximum available resolution
- Includes caption with alt text
- Close with X button, click outside, or Escape key

## Testing
Created `test-images.html` to compare original vs filtered images - useful for future debugging.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Click any carousel image** to view it enlarged
2. **Read the text** in the modal view
3. **Close the modal** by:
   - Clicking the X button
   - Clicking outside the image
   - Pressing Escape key
