# Website Structure Optimization - September 15, 2025

## Overview
Optimized the JS Multimédias website structure to improve user experience and navigation flow.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Bio Section Repositioning
- **Moved bio section** from bottom of page to immediately after hero section (lines 1010-1023)
- **Rationale**: Users want to know who they're working with before seeing services
- **Improved flow**: Hero → Bio → Services → Portfolio → Contact

### 2. Content Personalization
- **Changed from third-person to first-person narrative** in bio section
- **Enhanced authenticity**: "Je mets ma passion" instead of "Julie met sa passion"
- **Better connection**: Creates direct relationship with potential clients

### 3. Duplicate Content Removal
- **Eliminated duplicate bio section** that was causing confusion
- **Streamlined navigation**: Single, clear bio section improves user focus

### 4. Navigation Optimization
- **Smooth scrolling functionality** already implemented (lines 1450-1462)
- **Sticky header** with scroll effects for better orientation
- **Clear section anchors**: #bio, #services, #realisations, #contact

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
- **Image loading**: All images use `loading="lazy"` for performance
- **Modal system**: Image modal for portfolio items with click handlers
- **Scroll effects**: Header state changes based on scroll position

### UX Improvements
- **Reduced cognitive load**: Cleaner section flow
- **Personal connection**: First-person narrative builds trust
- **Visual hierarchy**: Consistent spacing and typography
- **Accessibility**: Proper alt tags and semantic HTML

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy loading**: Images load as needed
- **Optimized assets**: WebP and MP4 video formats
- **CSS transitions**: Smooth animations without JavaScript overhead

## Navigation Psychology
The new structure follows user mental models:
1. **Hero**: Immediate value proposition
2. **Bio**: Build trust and personal connection
3. **Services**: Detailed offerings
4. **Portfolio**: Social proof and capabilities
5. **Contact**: Clear next step

## Next Steps
1. **Test navigation flow** with real users
2. **Monitor bounce rates** on bio section
3. **A/B test** first-person vs third-person narrative
4. **Optimize mobile experience** for bio section positioning
